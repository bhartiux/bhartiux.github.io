						<p class="text-justify scrollimation fade-in" style="margin-top:65px;">I am a UX designer with a background in visual design & advertising. Throughout my career, I’ve designed creative and attractive solutions for public websites, internal portals, and advertising campaigns. While the results were always aesthetically pleasing, what was missing was a clear understanding of the needs and priorities of the users and the business and assurance that I was solving the right problem before applying my visual magic. My study of UX design has opened my eyes to the benefits of taking an iterative and user-centered approach to design, and I now have the UX design skills and methodologies at hand to ensure that I get the right design before I get the design right.</p>

					<p>Design is an iterative process, synthesizing information to create an informed solution for a purpose.<br/> The design process can be expressed in different ways, but each articulates the journey from exploration to iteration.<br/>This process helps you explores all options and not get married to one solution.<br/>For me my process starts by asking 'why' and 'how'.<br/>This approach is not just about design, it's about product/service development.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Overview</h3>
							<p>Incorta provides same day analytics for business users to allow businesses to use their data more quickly. It’s engineered to quickly and easily analyzes the massive volumes of data from multiple sources. The analytics platform also provides unparalleled security and mobility.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Challenges</h3>
							<p>The product performance is exceptional that analyzes massive volume of data in a short period of time. The catalog section of the product, which is the main interaction point with the users, is currently very static, unwelcoming, and offers very little guidance.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Solution</h3>
							<p>My team and I provided more engaging, intuitive, accessible and dashboards that, “Tells Stories" so that users can engage with the catalog.</p>


							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/incorta-solution.jpg"  alt=incorta solution">

							<p class="text-center">
								<a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/WU7RL0N8C"><button class="btn btn-meflat icon-left">View Prototype</button></a>
							</p>

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Design Method</h3>
							<p><img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/Incorta-designmethod.jpg"  alt="incorta solution"></p>
							
							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Discovery-Comparative & Competitive Analysis</h3>
							<p>After our kick off meeting, we got to know the competitors, based on that we did our market analysis and learned about them. But unique about Incorta from all them is that it handles large quantity of data, fast analysis report and simpler accessibility compared to Tableau. Stakeholders wanted similar functionality of Pinterest or Flicker where cards of dashboards are shown “Bundles The Content”.
							</br> <img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/discovery.jpg"  alt="Market Reaserch"></p>

							
							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Discovery-Assumptions</h3>
							<p>We got access to catalog so we started with heuristic evaluation to get familiar with the interface. We did it so that it could help us understand the key task & scenarios of the users experience. With initial evaluation my team and I came up that we needed more improvement on pages like landing page, tab structures, & search option was not clear. We got to understand that every user has a different role and access to all the dashboards. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that if we provide a catalog that is engaging it will increase the user interaction.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/assumption.jpg"  alt="incorta">
							
							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Design-Connecting Insight</h3>
							<p>After we gathered all our insights from our interviews we did some “GAMESTORMING” activities Affinity Mapping, its purpose was to reveal the compelling, high-level insight latent in raw data. We collected all ideas and results at most detailed level possible on sticky notes. We invited stakeholders to participate in the design studio, this rapid, iterative approach blends concept creation with critique. It is a great way to jumpstart your design process. Gave them pens and paper to everyone to design their thoughts. That help us better visualize the problem. </br>From that activity we got 3 top features to work on:
							</br>-Navigation (folder structures)
							</br>-Descriptions for dashboard
							</br>-Updates & Notification</p>
							<img class="img-responsive project-image" src="assets/incorta-designstudio.jpg"  alt="connecting insight">
							
							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Design-Early Sketches</h3>
							<p>After brainstorming ideas from design studio we started sketching ideas on white board & paper that allows us with different numbers of approaches. After multiple iterations we transferred those sketches into wireframe using sketch tool. We frequently kept updated with our stakeholders and got feedbacks that we integrated in our designs.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/incorta-early sketch.jpg"  
							alt="Sketches">

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Design-Refined Sketches & Testing</h3>
							<p>After multiple iteration of sketches it drove us to do the initial prototype, we did our usability testing with the user at Stanford.
							Feedback from user testing:
							</br>Needs Stanford brand after user logs in
							</br>Needs Folder structure changed
							</br>Need to know what if there are more sub categories.
							</br>After several iteration and usability testing, on initial sketches higher fidelity wireframes on sketch tool was incorporated.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Deliver-Interactive Prototype</h3>
							<p>After feedbacks and multiple iteration corrections were made from usability tests, we then used InVision to create clickable prototypes.</br>

							<h3 style="color:#5CA9D0">Results & Reflection</h3>
							<p>At the end of our two and a half weeks, we presented our findings and recommendations to the client and handed off the deliverables. The Incorta team was impressed by our solutions that we recommended in short period of time. They were really interested in “Mega Dashboard” approached. By streamlining navigation & cleaning up the tab structure helped Incorta catalog look simple & clear. I would want to work on other features, UI & Visuals. I would also perform more usability testing with more users that would helps improve the catalog design.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Overview</h3>
							<p>SFBC has been transforming San Francisco streets over 40 years into livable & safe neighborhoods by promoting  bicycle transportation. It’s  one of the most effective advocacy groups in the country.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Problem</h3>
							<p>How can we increase engagement with bike coalition members?</p>
							<p>Being located in one of the most technologically advanced cities in the world, we wanted to create a strategy and design for digital tools that engages members more frequently and give members a sense of active contribution to the SFBC’s larger goals. One of the biggest challenges that SFBC was facing was how to share safety & hazard issues among the members and raise that to advocacy to improve the rider’s experience.</p>
							
							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Solution</h3>
							<p>Created digital platform that facilitates the real time collection of data from cyclists and the display of aggregated data gathered from its members. My team and I provided the Mobile application that could help the bikers to connect with each other and help to improve the overall biking experience. This solution could help its members to voice their opinion and also help focus on promoting on issues that matter the most to SFBC members. </p>

							</p>

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Understanding Our Users</h3>
							<p>“Most important thing getting on the bike is safety”</p>
							<p>To get started and understand our user, we send out some survey with basic and demographic questions (answered by 60 people). After we researched the initial problem, and who the SFBC members are, we wanted to find out more about bicyclists in this city, what their experiences are, what their social sharing habits are and how that applies in the context of biking. We looked into some existing website for comparative & competitive analysis, like Silicon Valley Bile Coalition, Bike East Bay, Bike to Work Day, & San Francisco Aids organization. </p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/sfbc-survey.jpg"  alt="Survey Results">

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Process: Research</h3>
							<p>After getting more data from the survey, we wanted to understand our user what they feel and experience we started drilling some ideas on paper and the whiteboard to come up using Affinity Maps. We realized that people enjoy riding bike but they had fear and concern to do it in city due to conditions like traffic, safety & unsafe environment.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Persona Development</h3>
							<p>Based on our data from the interviews and comprehensive user research, we constructed personas to cater our design.</p>
							
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/persona-leslie01.jpg"  alt="Leslie">
							
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/persona-elizabeth01.jpg" alt="Elizabeth"></a>
							
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/persona-chase01.jpg" alt="Chase">

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Defining M.V.P</h3>
							<p>After brainstorming and understanding our users need my team and me crafted user maps and system flows that could helps us on prioritizing the main features for mobile app. We settled for 3 main features for our minimal viable product.
							Bike Park: To locate safe parking by reading the review from other members.
							Hazardous Activity Report: To report and find out about hazardous activities.
							Member Profile: To understand how much you have contributed by comparing from other members.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Design- Early Sketches</h3>
							<p>After understanding from our personas and the features they wanted did early paper sketches. Too many features, but it gave us a chance to map out the important vs. the non important. We started to draw correlations. What if the app could all revolve around a map?</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/earlysketches-sfbc.jpg"  alt="SFBC Team">

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Design- Refined Sketches & Testing </h3>
							<p>Conducted usability testing, on both paper sketch & wireframe stages. The feedback we received helped us improve upon the design for the final prototype, and emphasized the need for simplicity of the app.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/refinedsketches-sfbc.jpg"  alt="SFBC Team">

							<h3 style="color:#E47723">UI and Visual Design</h3>
							
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/sfbc-styleguide.jpg"  alt="SFBC Team">
							
							<h3 style="color:#E47723">Results & Reflections</h3>
							<p>In two weeks I got to understand the pain points of the bikers and provided the solutions based on those pain points to improve the bicycling experience. To make this app successful I would do more usability testing and more research with bike riders. I would like to work on other features, too. As the user base grows I would start advertising so that it gets more traffic to the app.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Overview</h3>
							<p>Progress Hardware has been the Inner Sunset's neighborhood hardware store since 1948. The business model is very much based on customers hand-selected products at competitive prices, provide expert advice, deliver personal customer service, and get involved in the community. I was asked to improve their website and add an e-commerce component to the site.</p>

							
							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Challenges</h3>
							<p>To build a website that has an ecommerce component and also not to loose the face-to-face contact they have with their customers. The website should allow to clear the way of locating specific products and have them shipped to their home or worksite or picked up at the store.</p>


							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Solution</h3>
							<p>I provided a landing page that has clear organized product lists, simple and faster check out process that has different shipping options for current and potential customers. The solution provided will help the client increase online sales, and not loose the personal touch of the neighborhood shop that started.</p>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Discovery - Comparative & Competitive Analysis</h3>
							<p>After our kick off meeting, we got to know the competitors, based on that we did our 
							market analysis and learned about them, but the unique about progress hardware they want to maintain their customers trust.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-comparative.jpg"  alt="PH Analysis"><br/>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Persona Development</h3>
							<p>Three personas were developed, after understanding personas it was very clear that users wanted a faster checkout system, different shipping options, online customer support & product details. I wanted to offer design to the site that it allows all these options.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-andy.jpg"  alt="Andy">
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-lisa.jpg"  alt="Lisa">
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-thomas.jpg"  alt="Thomas"><br/>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">System Map and User Flows</h3>
							<p>I mapped out the system map & user flows for my three primary users: 
							<br/>-Andy, the tradesman professional, who is the frequent shopper. He needed faster checkout process that also has easy search option with same day shipping option. 
							<br/>-Lisa, being DYI enthusiast, needed some kind of education components.
							<br/>-Thomas, is the busy business analyst, he needed ability to search items quickly & in-depth customer reviews.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-systemmap.jpg"  alt="System Map">
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-andysflow.jpg"  alt="Andy's Flow">

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Research - Card Sorting</h3>
							<p>I used Andy as my primary user, he is a 45 year old tradesman. Almost 90% of his work time is spent on site and he doesn’t like wasting time going to pick up supplies while on the job. He orders all the supplies and tools online and has them shipped to his first work site of the day.After understanding from my user needs I did card sorting activity using Optimal Workshop with 50 participants. This technique helped me evaluate and improve the structure of information on the website in a logical hierarchical way.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-cardsorting.jpg"  alt="PH Analysis"><BR/>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Design - Early Sketches</h3>
							<p>After understanding from our personas and the features, I did early paper sketches and transferred those to low-fidelity wireframes.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/ph-earlysketches01.jpg"  alt="PH Early Sketch"><br/>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Design - Refined Sketches</h3>
							<p>I did some usability testing and after multiple feedbacks. Here is my final wireframes that shows the process:
							<br/>-Faster search option
							<br/>-Same day shipping options
							<br/>-Easy & faster check out process</p>

							<img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/Ph-Homepage.jpg"  alt="PH Analysis"><br/>

							<h3 style="color:#A60D00">Next Steps</h3>
							<p>I'd want to work on other features such as UI & Visuals in depth. And would work to make the design responsive so that customers could shop from anywhere. Do more usability testing to improve the product.</p>
